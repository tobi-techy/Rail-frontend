# Rail — Product Brief (Definitive)

## 1. Overview

Rail is an automated wealth system designed for a generation that wants progress without the extra effort of participation.

When money enters Rail, it doesn’t wait. It doesn’t ask questions. It doesn’t sit idle.

**It immediately goes to work.**

Rail removes the cognitive, emotional, and operational burden of investing by replacing choice with rules, and hesitation with motion. Users don’t manage money inside Rail — they hand it off to a system engineered to act.

---

## 2. The Core Problem

Modern investing demands too much from the user.

It asks them to:

- Choose assets they don’t understand
- Assess risk they can’t quantify
- Time markets they don’t trust
- Live with decisions they constantly second-guess

For younger users especially, this responsibility creates paralysis. Most want their money to grow, but they don’t want to _be investors_.

Modern finance is fragmented.

Users are forced to split their financial lives across:

- A bank account for spending

- An investing app for growth

- Tools for taxes, accounting, and tracking

Each product demands attention, decisions, and financial literacy.

The result isn’t empowerment — it’s cognitive overload.

People don’t fail because they lack discipline. They fail because the system is broken.

Rail exists to replace fragmented tools with one coherent system.

**Access was solved years ago. Direction was not.**

Rail exists to eliminate responsibility without eliminating upside.

## 3. Rail’s Philosophy

Rail is built on a single belief:

> Money should start working the moment it arrives.

No configuration. No tuning. No financial literacy required.

Loading funds into Rail is a conscious decision to step out of the way and let a system operate.

This is not assisted investing.
This is delegated momentum.

---

## 4. How Rail Works (System-Level View)

Rail operates as a rules-based capital engine with a permanent default allocation model.

### Funding Methods

Users can load money into Rail through two channels:

- **Virtual Accounts**: Dedicated USD or GBP virtual accounts for bank transfers
- **Crypto On-Ramp**: USDC deposits from Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, or Solana

Both methods trigger the same automatic split behavior.

### The Rail Split

Every deposit into Rail is automatically divided the moment it clears:

- **70% → Base Rail**
  The stability layer. Capital preservation, liquidity, and low-volatility positioning.

- **30% → Active Rail**
  The growth layer. AI-managed deployment into diversified, personalized assets.

This split:

- Applies to every deposit
- Cannot be edited in the MVP
- Requires no approval
- Is explained simply as “how Rail works”

The user never allocates. The system does.

---

## 5. Active Rail — The Intelligence Layer

Active Rail is where growth happens.

The moment capital is allocated, Active Rail begins investing automatically. There are no trade confirmations, asset selections, or strategy choices presented to the user.

Personalization is inferred through system signals rather than user input. These may include:

- Age and geographic region
- Deposit size and frequency
- Time-based behavior patterns
- A global default strategy as fallback

To the user, this feels instant, decisive, and inevitable.

Rail does not teach users how investing works. It demonstrates that it works.

---

## 6. Spend Layer — Everyday Money

The Spend layer is the user’s primary financial surface.

It is designed to fully replace a traditional checking account.

**Core Capabilities**

- Spend balance for daily expenses

- Instant access to funds

- Physical and virtual Rail debit card

**Card as a Growth Trigger**

Rail’s debit card is not passive infrastructure — it is an automation engine.

Every transaction can:

- Round up spare change and route it into investing automatically

- Generate cashback that flows directly into the Invest Engine

Users never “decide” to invest more. Spending naturally compounds into growth.

## 6.5 Conductors — Expert-Led Tracks

For users who want guided growth without self-directed decisions, Rail offers Conductors.

**What is a Conductor?**

A Conductor is a verified professional investor who creates and manages Tracks — curated portfolios of assets that followers can automatically mirror.

**The Metaphor**

- A **Conductor** leads the investment journey
- A **Track** is the path they create (a portfolio of assets like Apple, ETFs, etc.)
- **Followers** ride the track — their capital automatically mirrors the Conductor's moves

**How It Works**

1. Conductors apply, get reviewed, and are approved based on credentials and experience
2. Approved Conductors create Tracks with specific asset allocations
3. Users browse Tracks and choose to follow one or more
4. A portion of the user's Active Rail is allocated to the Track
5. When the Conductor adjusts the Track, followers' positions update automatically

**Conductor Application Flow**

- Must have an existing Rail account before applying
- Submit application with investment experience and credentials
- Admin review for background check and compliance
- Approval grants Conductor status
- Conductor creates profile and first Track

**Track Characteristics**

- Named strategy (e.g., "Tech Growth", "Dividend Income")
- Curated assets with target weights
- Risk level indicator
- Performance history visible to potential followers

**User Experience**

- Discover Conductors and their Tracks
- View performance, risk level, and follower count
- Follow with one tap — allocate a portion of Active Rail
- Unfollow anytime — positions liquidate back to Active Rail

**Why Conductors Fit Rail's Philosophy**

Conductors extend Rail's core principle: users delegate decisions to systems (or experts) that act on their behalf. Following a Track requires no ongoing input — the Conductor leads, the system mirrors, the user benefits.

This is not self-directed investing. This is choosing who to trust, then letting go.

Rail’s experience is designed around trust through action, not education.

**Core principles:**

- Fewer decisions increase confidence
- Speed creates belief
- Defaults outperform settings
- State matters more than detail

## 7. User Experience Principles

Rail’s experience is designed around trust through action, not education.

**Core principles:**

- Fewer decisions increase confidence
- Speed creates belief
- Defaults outperform settings
- State matters more than detail

If a screen requires explanation, it’s wrong.
If a user hesitates, something failed.

---

## 8. The Core User Flow

Rail’s primary flow is intentionally minimal:

1. Download the app
2. Sign up
3. Load funds
4. Money starts moving

There are no branching paths, no optional setup steps, and no strategic forks.

Everything beyond this is internal execution.

---

## 9. The Station (Home Experience)

The home screen exists to answer one question only:

> “Is my money working?”

It shows:

- Total balance
- Base Rail vs Active Rail allocation
- Current system state: Allocating / Moving / Paused

It does not show:

- Individual assets
- Charts or timelines
- Trade history

Rail communicates direction, not detail.

---

## 10. Trust Without Overexplanation

Rail builds trust the same way reliable infrastructure does — by functioning predictably and immediately.

Trust comes from:

- Predictable capital deployment
- Consistent rules
- Calm, confident language

Not from:

- Tutorials
- Financial education
- Excessive transparency

Users trust systems that move without asking.

---

## 11. What Rail Is — and Is Not

Rail **is**:

- An automated capital engine
- A rules-based wealth system
- A product that replaces decision-making

Rail **is not**:

- A brokerage
- A trading app
- A robo-advisor
- A crypto exchange

Those products require participation.
Rail requires trust.

---

## 12. Success Criteria

Rail succeeds when:

- Capital is deployed within seconds of deposit
- Users rarely intervene or pause automation
- Repeat deposits happen naturally

If users feel the need to manage, optimize, or control, the product has failed its mission.

---

## 13. One-Line Definition

**Rail is an automated wealth system where money begins working the moment it arrives — no decisions, no delay, just momentum.**
