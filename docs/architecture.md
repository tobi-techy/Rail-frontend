### STACK Architecture Document (v0.2 - Go/DriveWealth)

## 1\. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for STACK, refactored for a **Go** backend. It details the integration of **Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets** for wallet management/funding and **DriveWealth** as the brokerage partner. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This document covers the backend services. A separate Frontend Architecture Document (for React Native) MUST be used in conjunction with this one.

  * **Starter Template or Existing Project:** N/A - Greenfield project. We are defining the structure from scratch.

  * **Change Log:**
    | Date | Version | Description | Author |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | Sept 27, 2025 | v0.1 | Initial NestJS architecture. | Winston |
    | Oct 24, 2025 | v0.2 | Complete rewrite for Go, DriveWealth, and Circle pivot. | Winston |

## 2\. High Level Architecture

#### 2.1 Technical Summary

This architecture is a **Go-based modular monolith** deployed on AWS Fargate (ECS). The system exposes a unified GraphQL API (via an API Gateway) to the React Native mobile app. It integrates three critical external partners: **Auth0/Cognito** (Identity), **Circle** (Wallets, USDC On/Off-Ramps), and **DriveWealth** (Brokerage, Custody). Data is persisted in **PostgreSQL**. This design supports the MVP goal of providing a hybrid Web3-to-TradFi investment flow.

#### 2.2 High Level Overview

  * **Architectural Style:** Modular Monolith (to start).
  * **Repository Structure:** Monorepo (recommended).
  * **Service Architecture:** A single Go application separated into logical domain modules (Onboarding, Wallet, Funding, Investing, AI-CFO) that communicate internally.
  * **Data Flow (Funding):** User deposits USDC (on-chain) -\> Monitored by Funding Service -\> Circle Off-Ramp (USDC to USD) -\> DriveWealth Deposit (USD) -\> "Buying Power" updated.
  * **Data Flow (Withdrawal):** User requests USD withdrawal -\> DriveWealth debits account -\> Circle On-Ramp (USD to USDC) -\> Funding Service sends USDC (on-chain) to user.

    end
```

#### 2.4 Architectural and Design Patterns

  * **Modular Monolith:** A single Go application with strongly defined internal boundaries (Go modules) for each domain (Onboarding, Funding, etc.). This allows for faster MVP development while making future extraction into microservices straightforward.
  * **Repository Pattern:** Used to abstract all database interactions. Go interfaces will define data access methods, with concrete implementations for PostgreSQL, ensuring testability and separation of concerns.
  * **Adapter Pattern:** Used extensively for all external partner integrations (Circle, DriveWealth, 0G). Go interfaces will define the *required* functionality (e.g., `BrokerageAdapter`), and concrete structs will implement those interfaces by calling the specific partner APIs.
  * **Asynchronous Orchestration (Sagas):** The complex funding (USDC -\> USD -\> Broker) and withdrawal (Broker -\> USD -\> USDC) flows will be managed using an asynchronous, event-driven approach (even within the monolith) to handle multi-step processes and failures.

Okay, thanks for those specifics. I've updated the Tech Stack section with your choices for the Go backend components. The TBDs for the web framework, logging, DB driver, and caching are now resolved.

Here's the updated **Section 3: Tech Stack**.

---

## 3. Tech Stack

This section defines the specific technologies and versions that **MUST** be used for the STACK MVP implementation. These choices are based on the **Go** backend requirement, **React Native** frontend, and integration with **Circle** and **DriveWealth**.

**Rationale:** The stack prioritizes mature ecosystems, type safety where possible (Go/TypeScript), and alignment with our chosen partners and cloud platform (AWS). Specific versions are pinned to ensure consistency and avoid unexpected breaking changes.

#### 3.1 Cloud Infrastructure
* **Provider:** AWS
* **Key Services:** Fargate (ECS), RDS (PostgreSQL), **ElastiCache (Redis)**, SQS, Secrets Manager, S3, API Gateway (REST/GraphQL endpoint), CloudFront, WAF
* **Deployment Regions:** TBD (e.g., us-east-1)

Okay, let's proceed to **Section 5: Components**.

-----

## 5\. Components

The STACK backend will start as a **Go-based modular monolith**. Functionality is divided into distinct Go modules, each responsible for a specific domain. These modules communicate internally via Go function calls and interfaces initially.

#### 5.1 Component List

  * **Onboarding Service Module**

      * **Responsibility:** Handles user sign-up, profile management, KYC/AML orchestration, passcode setup/verification, and feature flag checks.
      * **Key Interfaces:**
          * Internal: `CreateUser`, `GetUserProfile`, `UpdateKYCStatus`, `SetPasscode`, `VerifyPasscode`.
          * External (via GraphQL Gateway): Mutations for sign-up, profile updates; Queries for user status.
      * **Dependencies:** `Auth Provider (IDP)`, `KYC/AML Provider`, `Wallet Service Module` (to trigger wallet creation), `Database (users table)`.
      * **Technology Stack:** Go module.

  * **Wallet Service Module**

```

**Explanation:**

  * **`go.work`:** Defines the Go workspace, allowing multiple modules within `internal/` and `pkg/` to be treated as part of the same build context.
  * **`cmd/api/`:** Contains the `main.go` file which initializes and starts the Gin web server and GraphQL endpoint.
  * **`internal/`:** Houses the core application logic, not intended to be imported by other Go projects outside this monorepo.
      * **`api/`:** Handles incoming GraphQL requests, routing them to the appropriate core service modules. Contains resolvers and API-specific middleware.
      * **`core/`:** Contains the primary business logic, organized by domain (Onboarding, Funding, etc.). Each domain module should define its own interfaces and structs.
      * **`adapters/`:** Implements clients for interacting with all external services (Circle, DriveWealth, etc.), adhering to interfaces defined perhaps in `core/` or `pkg/`.
      * **`persistence/`:** Implements the Repository pattern for database interactions, specific to PostgreSQL (`lib/pq`).
      * **`config/`:** Handles loading configuration from environment variables or files.
  * **`pkg/common/`:** Contains truly generic code (e.g., custom error types, utility functions, shared data structures) that *could* potentially be reused across different Go projects.
  * **`infrastructure/`:** Terraform code for managing AWS resources.
  * **`api/graph/`:** Location for the GraphQL schema files.
  * **`web/`:** Placeholder. The React Native app might live here or in a separate repository depending on team preference.

## 10\. Infrastructure and Deployment

This section defines the cloud infrastructure setup on AWS and the CI/CD process for deploying the Go backend application.

#### 10.1 Infrastructure as Code

  * **Tool:** Terraform v1.6.x.
  * **Location:** `infrastructure/aws/` within the monorepo.
  * **Approach:** Define reusable Terraform modules for core components (ECS Service, RDS Database, SQS Queue, ElastiCache Redis Cluster). Manage environments (dev, staging, prod) using Terraform workspaces or separate state files. State will be stored remotely (e.g., in S3 with locking via DynamoDB).

#### 10.2 Deployment Strategy

  * **Strategy:** Blue/Green deployments for the Go API service on AWS Fargate (ECS). This allows for zero-downtime releases. Traffic shifting will be managed via Application Load Balancer (ALB) target groups or potentially AWS CodeDeploy.
  * **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions.
  * **Pipeline Configuration:** Workflow files located in `.github/workflows/`. Separate workflows for build/test (on PR), staging deploy (on merge to `main`), and production deploy (manual trigger or tag).

#### 10.3 Environments

  * **Development:** Local development using Docker Compose to spin up Postgres, Redis, and potentially mocks for external services.
  * **Staging:** Deployed on AWS, mirroring production infrastructure but scaled down. Used for end-to-end testing and QA. Connected to partner sandbox APIs.
  * **Production:** Deployed on AWS, configured for high availability and scalability. Connected to partner production APIs.

#### 10.4 Environment Promotion Flow

```text
[Local Dev] -> [Feature Branch PR] -> [CI Tests Pass] -> [Merge to main] -> [Staging Deploy] -> [Manual QA/Tests] -> [Promote to Production (Manual Trigger/Tag)] -> [Production Deploy (Blue/Green)]
```

#### 10.5 Rollback Strategy

  * **Primary Method:** Utilize ECS Blue/Green deployment capabilities. If the "green" deployment fails health checks or post-deployment tests, traffic remains on the "blue" (previous stable) version. Manual rollback involves redirecting ALB traffic back to the blue target group.
  * **Trigger Conditions:** Failed health checks post-deployment, critical error rate spikes detected by monitoring, failed automated post-deployment smoke tests.
  * **Database Rollback:** Handled via migration tooling (e.g., `goose down`). Critical schema changes should be backward compatible where possible to facilitate easier rollbacks. Non-reversible migrations require careful planning and potential data migration rollbacks.

## 11. Error Handling Strategy

A consistent error handling strategy is crucial for maintainability and observability, especially in a system involving multiple external partners. We will leverage Go's standard error handling mechanisms combined with structured logging and resilience patterns.

#### 11.1 General Approach
* **Error Model:** Go's standard `error` interface. Errors should be wrapped with context as they propagate up the call stack (e.g., using `fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", err)` or a library like `pkg/errors`).
* **Exception Hierarchy:** Define custom error types (structs implementing the `error` interface) for specific domain errors (e.g., `ErrInsufficientFunds`, `ErrKYCFailed`, `ErrBrokerOrderRejected`) to allow for programmatic handling. Standard library errors (e.g., `io.EOF`, `sql.ErrNoRows`) should be handled appropriately.
* **Error Propagation:** Functions should return errors rather than panicking. The top-level handlers (e.g., Gin middleware, GraphQL resolvers) will be responsible for catching errors, logging them, and returning appropriate responses to the client.

#### 11.2 Logging Standards
* **Library:** **Zap** (uber-go/zap).
* **Format:** Structured JSON format for easy parsing by log aggregators (e.g., CloudWatch Logs Insights, Datadog).
* **Levels:** Use standard levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal, Panic). Default level in production should be Info, configurable via environment variables.
* **Required Context:**
    * **Correlation ID:** Automatically injected into the `context.Context` (e.g., via middleware) and included in every log message. This ID should ideally originate from the incoming request or be generated for background jobs. Trace IDs from **OpenTelemetry** can serve this purpose.
    * **Service Context:** Module name (e.g., "FundingService", "InvestingService").
    * **User Context:** User ID (if available and relevant, taking care not to log PII unnecessarily).
    * **Error Details:** Include the full wrapped error string and potentially a stack trace for unexpected errors (Error level and above).

#### 11.3 Error Handling Patterns
* **External API Errors (Circle, DriveWealth, etc.):**
    * [cite_start]**Retry Policy:** Implement configurable exponential backoff retries for transient network errors or specific idempotent API calls[cite: 797].
    * [cite_start]**Circuit Breaker:** Use **gobreaker** for critical external dependencies (especially DriveWealth trading, Circle on/off-ramps) to prevent cascading failures[cite: 797]. Monitor breaker state (open, half-open, closed).
    * [cite_start]**Timeout Configuration:** Configure appropriate timeouts for all external HTTP requests[cite: 797].
    * [cite_start]**Error Translation:** Translate partner-specific error codes/messages into standardized internal error types for consistent handling[cite: 797]. Log the original partner error for debugging.
* **Business Logic Errors:**
    * [cite_start]**Custom Errors:** Use the defined custom error types (e.g., `ErrInsufficientFunds`) to signal specific business rule violations[cite: 798].
    * **User-Facing Errors:** API Gateway/GraphQL layer translates internal errors into user-friendly messages. Avoid exposing internal details. [cite_start]Return standard GraphQL error responses[cite: 798].
    * [cite_start]**Error Codes:** Consider defining a simple internal error code system for easier frontend handling and monitoring, mapped from internal error types[cite: 798].
* **Data Consistency:**
    * [cite_start]**Transaction Strategy:** Use database transactions (`lib/pq`) for operations requiring atomicity (e.g., updating order status and positions)[cite: 799].
    * [cite_start]**Compensation Logic (Sagas):** For multi-step asynchronous flows (Funding/Withdrawal involving SQS), implement compensating actions to revert steps in case of failure (e.g., if DriveWealth funding fails after Circle off-ramp, flag for manual review or attempt refund via Circle)[cite: 799].
    * [cite_start]**Idempotency:** Ensure message handlers (SQS) and critical API endpoints are idempotent (can be safely called multiple times with the same input) to handle retries and message duplication[cite: 799].

## 12. Coding Standards

These standards are **MANDATORY** for all developers, including AI agents, working on the STACK backend. They are kept minimal to focus on project-specific consistency and critical rules, assuming general Go best practices are followed. These will guide code generation and review.

#### 12.1 Core Standards
* **Languages & Runtimes:** **Go 1.21.x**. Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt` / `goimports`).
* **Style & Linting:** Use `golangci-lint` with a pre-defined configuration (to be added to the repo). Enforce standard Go conventions (effective Go).
* **Test Organization:** Test files should be named `*_test.go` and reside in the same package/directory as the code being tested. Use Go's standard `testing` package.

#### 12.2 Naming Conventions
* **Packages:** `lowercase`, short, concise names (e.g., `funding`, `adapters`, `persistence`).
* **Structs/Interfaces/Types:** `PascalCase`.
* **Variables/Functions:** `camelCase`. Exported functions/variables start with an uppercase letter.
* **Constants:** `PascalCase` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (be consistent within a module).
* **Acronyms:** Treat acronyms like `ID`, `URL`, `API` as single words in names (e.g., `userID`, `apiClient`, not `UserId`, `ApiClient`).

#### 12.3 Critical Rules (For AI Agent Guidance)
* **Error Handling:**
    * **NEVER** ignore errors. Check every error returned by function calls.
    * Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` when propagating.
    * Define and use custom error types (e.g., `var ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found")`) for specific business logic failures.
* **Context Propagation:** Pass `context.Context` as the first argument to functions involved in requests or background tasks. Use it for deadlines, cancellation signals, and passing request-scoped values (like correlation IDs).
* **Database Access:** **MUST** use the Repository pattern defined in `internal/persistence/`. **NEVER** use `lib/pq` directly within core business logic (`internal/core/`).
* **External API Calls:** **MUST** go through the defined Adapters in `internal/adapters/`. **NEVER** make direct HTTP calls to external services from core business logic.
* **Configuration:** Access configuration values **ONLY** via the `internal/config/` package. **NEVER** read environment variables directly elsewhere.
* **Logging:** Use the configured **Zap** logger instance. **NEVER** use `fmt.Println` or `log.Println` for application logging. Include correlation ID from context.
* **Concurrency:** Use Go's standard concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels) carefully. Avoid race conditions (use `go run -race ./...` during development). Favor structured concurrency patterns where possible.
* **Secrets:** **NEVER** hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords). Retrieve them via the configuration system which loads from AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables. Do not log secrets.
* **Input Validation:** Validate **ALL** input at the API boundary (GraphQL resolvers / Gin handlers). Use a standard validation library if adopted, otherwise perform explicit checks.

## 13. Test Strategy and Standards

This section defines the testing approach for the Go backend, ensuring code quality, reliability, and alignment with requirements.

#### 13.1 Testing Philosophy
* **Approach:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) is encouraged but not strictly required. Comprehensive tests **must** be written for all critical paths, business logic, and integrations. Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details.
* **Coverage Goals:** Aim for >80% code coverage for core business logic modules. Integration tests should cover all major API endpoints and external interactions.
* **Test Pyramid:** Emphasize unit tests for isolated logic, followed by integration tests for module/service interactions, and a smaller set of end-to-end (E2E) tests covering critical user flows (though E2E might be owned by a separate QA process or team).

#### 13.2 Test Types and Organization
* **Unit Tests:**
    * **Framework:** Go standard `testing` package, potentially augmented with `stretchr/testify` for assertions and mocking (`gomock` or `testify/mock`).
    * **File Convention:** `*_test.go` in the same package as the code under test.
    * **Location:** Same directory as the source code.
    * **Mocking:** Mock external dependencies (database repositories, external API adapters) using interfaces and mocking libraries.
    * **AI Agent Requirements:** Generate unit tests covering primary success paths, error conditions, and edge cases for all exported functions/methods in core modules. Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * **Scope:** Test interactions between internal modules (e.g., API layer calling a core service module which interacts with persistence) and between the service and external dependencies (database, SQS, Redis, potentially mocked external APIs).
    * **Location:** Potentially in a separate `_test` package within the module or a dedicated top-level `test/integration` directory.
    * **Test Infrastructure:**
        * **Database:** Use **Testcontainers** to spin up a real PostgreSQL container for integration tests.
        * **Cache (Redis):** Use **Testcontainers** for a Redis container.
        * **Queue (SQS):** Use localstack or a similar AWS emulator, or Testcontainers with an SQS-compatible image.
        * **External APIs (Circle, DriveWealth):** Use **WireMock** or a Go HTTP mocking library (like `go-vcr`) to stub responses during integration tests.
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Minimal for Backend Focus):**
    * **Framework:** TBD (Potentially simple Go HTTP client tests, or dedicated frameworks like Cypress/Playwright if testing via UI).
    * **Scope:** Verify critical API flows from request to response, potentially including database state changes.
    * **Environment:** Run against a deployed staging environment.

#### 13.3 Test Data Management
* **Strategy:** Use helper functions or fixture libraries within tests to create necessary prerequisite data (e.g., creating a user before testing wallet creation). Avoid relying on a shared, mutable test database state.
* **Fixtures:** Store reusable setup data (e.g., JSON payloads for mocks) in `testdata` subdirectories.
* **Cleanup:** Tests should clean up after themselves where possible (e.g., deleting created records), especially when interacting with external mocked services or shared resources like containers. Testcontainers helps manage container lifecycles.

#### 13.4 Continuous Testing
* **CI Integration:** GitHub Actions will run `go test ./...` (including `-race` flag) on every pull request. Build must pass tests before merging.
* **Performance Tests:** Basic load testing (e.g., using `k6`, `vegeta`, or `go-wrk`) can be added to the CI pipeline for key endpoints, run against the staging environment.
* **Security Tests:** Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools (like `gosec`) into the CI pipeline.
