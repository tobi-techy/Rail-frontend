# Product Overview

## Project Identity
**RAIL** - A Web3-native investment platform designed for Gen Z investors, bridging stablecoins and traditional assets with a seamless, mobile-first experience.

## Core Value Proposition
RAIL provides Gen Z with instant funding via stablecoins (USDC) and direct investment into stocks, ETFs, and curated baskets—without traditional banking delays. It combines Web3 speed and accessibility with regulated investing security.

## Key Differentiators
- **Instant Funding**: Deposit USDC from major blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Solana) and start investing immediately
- **AI-Powered Protection**: Personal AI CFO that provides weekly summaries, on-demand analysis, and protective insights

- **Borderless Finance**: No traditional bank account required—true "money without borders"
- **Curated Investment Baskets**: Expert-designed portfolios aligned with Gen Z values (sustainability, impact)

## Target Users
**Primary Persona: "Taylor"** - A 22-year-old digitally native multi-tasker who wants financial empowerment on her own terms. Waiting for something more than Cash App, simpler than Coinbase, and fairer than Robinhood.
